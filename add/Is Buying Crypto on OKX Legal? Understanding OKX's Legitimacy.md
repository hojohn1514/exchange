OKX has long been a well-known and trusted name in the cryptocurrency industry. It is known for its simple interface, fast fund transfers, and robust security measures, making it a reliable platform for trading digital assets. Buying crypto on OKX is legal and complies with international regulations.

### Legal Recognition of Bitcoin Transactions

In China, Bitcoin has been legally defined as a "special virtual commodity" since the release of the 2014 notice "Prevention of Bitcoin Risks" by the People's Bank of China and four other government agencies. The notice clarifies Bitcoinâ€™s nature and outlines its regulation:

- Bitcoin transactions are legally protected as virtual commodities.
- Websites providing Bitcoin registration and trading services are required to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) measures.
- Such platforms must implement real-name registration and report suspicious transactions to authorities.
- Using Bitcoin for illegal activities like fraud, gambling, or money laundering must be reported to law enforcement.
