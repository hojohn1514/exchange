## How Are Bitcoin Contract Fees Calculated?

Contract fees are charged based on the size of your position. For example, as an LV1 user on OKX, the fee structure is as follows:  
- **Maker Fee:** 0.02%  
- **Taker Fee:** 0.05%  

If you open a position with 1 EOS using 10x leverage, your position size will be 10 EOS. The opening fee will range between **0.002 to 0.005 EOS**, depending on whether youâ€™re a maker or a taker. Similarly, closing fees are calculated based on your closing quantity.  

Hereâ€™s a quick breakdown:  
- If your order matches with an existing order in the market (taker), the fee is higher (0.005 EOS).  
- If your order waits in the market to be matched (maker), the fee is lower (0.002 EOS).  
- Partial matches will result in a fee somewhere between these two ranges.

### Terminology
- **Taker Orders:** Orders that actively match with existing ones in the market (higher fee).  
- **Maker Orders:** Orders that are posted to the market and wait to be matched (lower fee).

### 3. Choose the Contract Type
- **Perpetual Contracts:** No expiration date; suitable for short-term trading.  
- **Quarterly Contracts:** Longer expiration period; ideal for long-term positions.  

#### Recommendations:
- Focus on mainstream cryptocurrencies (e.g., BTC, ETH) for better liquidity and deeper markets.

### 4. Key Settings for Contract Trading
Proper setup is essential to avoid liquidation.

#### Configuration Includes:
- **Settlement Currency:** USD or your chosen asset.  
- **Trading Unit:** Corresponding cryptocurrency (e.g., BTC, ETH, EOS).  
- **Margin Mode:**  
  1. **Cross Margin:** Utilizes all available funds in your account to prevent liquidation. Best for experienced traders.  
  2. **Isolated Margin:** Limits risk to the funds allocated for a specific position. Recommended for beginners.  
- **Leverage:** Beginners should start with 10x leverage and move to 20x after gaining experience.

### 5. Opening a Position
- Go to the trading interface and click "Open Position."  
- Choose:
  - **Buy/Long:** If you expect the price to rise.
  - **Sell/Short:** If you expect the price to fall.  
- Input your desired leverage, price, and quantity, then confirm.

#### Order Types:
- **Limit Orders:** Specify your price; execution waits for market conditions to match.
- **Market Orders:** Instant execution at current market prices.

### 6. Managing Positions
Once your position is open:
- View active positions under **"Holdings."**  
- Unfilled orders appear under **"Pending."**  

You can adjust your margin if the market moves against you to avoid liquidation.

#### Example:
- **Position Size:** 10 EOS (10x leverage; effectively collateralizing 1 EOS).  
- **P&L Tracking:** Check performance indicators like entry price, current price, and margin levels.
