# Understanding OKX Tokens: Types and Insights

## Introduction to Blockchain Tokens

Tokens are an integral part of the blockchain ecosystem, representing ownership, utility, or access within a network. In this article, weâ€™ll explore the different types of tokens and their roles in the blockchain world. Before diving into why tokens signify ownership of a blockchain network, letâ€™s first understand their categories.

## Categories of Blockchain Tokens

Tokens can be broadly classified into two types:
1. **Native Tokens**: Built into the blockchain to support basic network operations.
2. **Smart Contract-Based Tokens**: Created through smart contracts and serve various purposes like stability, utility, or governance.

---

### Native Tokens

Native tokens are issued directly by the blockchain and are essential for its operation. They are used to pay gas fees and reward miners (or validators) who maintain the network. Popular examples include:
- **$ETH** (Ethereum)
- **$SOL** (Solana)

Native tokens play a critical role in facilitating transactions and ensuring the smooth functioning of their respective blockchains.

### Smart Contract-Based Tokens

In addition to native tokens, there are over 1,000 blockchains today running unique smart contracts. These contracts allow developers to create custom tokens with predefined functionalities. To ensure compatibility across platforms, token standards like **ERC-20** (Ethereum) and **BEP-20** (Binance Smart Chain) were established.

#### ERC-20: The Token Standard
Introduced in 2015, the ERC-20 standard provides a unified framework for token creation and interaction. This standardization reduces development complexity and costs while enhancing token compatibility across applications.

## Types of Smart Contract Tokens

Two common types of ERC-20 tokens include **Stablecoins** and **Utility Tokens**.

### Stablecoins: The Cornerstone of Market Stability

Stablecoins are designed to reduce volatility in the crypto market by pegging their value to stable assets like fiat currencies or gold. They combine the stability of traditional currencies with the flexibility of digital assets. Investors can use stablecoins to:
- Hedge against market fluctuations
- Earn interest through lending
- Boost liquidity in crypto markets

#### Types of Stablecoins

1. **Fiat-Collateralized Stablecoins**
   - Backed by reserves of fiat currency, such as the US Dollar.
   - Popular examples: **$USDT**, **$USDC**.
   - Issued by centralized institutions with strict reserve requirements.

2. **Crypto-Collateralized Stablecoins**
   - Backed by other cryptocurrencies (e.g., **$ETH**) as collateral.
   - To account for crypto volatility, over-collateralization is often required.
   - Example: **$DAI** by MakerDAO.

3. **Algorithmic Stablecoins**
   - Not backed by collateral but managed through smart contracts.
   - Supply adjusts dynamically based on market demand.
   - Example: **$UST** (prior to its decoupling in May 2022).

### Utility Tokens: Powering Blockchain Applications

Utility tokens are issued by decentralized applications (**DApps**) and serve multiple purposes:
- **Governance**: Allow token holders to vote on project development.
- **Revenue Sharing**: Offer holders a share of project profits.
- **Rewards**: Incentivize users for platform activity.

For instance:
- **$UNI** (Uniswap): Used for governance and rewarding liquidity providers.
- **$FTT** (FTX Exchange): Offers trading fee discounts, referral bonuses, and exclusive rewards to token holders.

Exchanges often issue their own utility tokens to enhance user engagement by providing discounts, governance rights, and additional perks.

## Conclusion

Understanding the types of tokensâ€”**native tokens** and **smart contract-based tokens**â€”is essential for navigating the blockchain ecosystem. Whether itâ€™s stablecoins offering market stability or utility tokens empowering decentralized applications, tokens remain a vital element in the ever-evolving cryptocurrency space.
