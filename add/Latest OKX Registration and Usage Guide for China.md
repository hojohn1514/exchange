# Latest OKX Registration and Usage Guide for China

## Introduction

OKX (originally called OKEX) was established in 2017 as a well-known Bitcoin trading platform, founded by Star Xu (former CTO of Douban). 

Similar to Binance, OKX initially had its headquarters in Beijing, China. However, due to regulatory changes surrounding cryptocurrencies in China, the platform relocated its headquarters overseas. Currently, OKX operates out of Seychelles, and users in China can still access the platform without restrictions.

## How to Register an OKX Account

Due to certain restrictions, you may not be able to access the OKX official website without a VPN. It is highly recommended to use Google Search with a reliable VPN to ensure proper access. Additionally, it is advisable to register using a Gmail account, which further simplifies the process.

### Recommended VPN Services

For smooth access, here are two VPN services we recommend:

- **[MojieVPN: Reliable, fast, and affordable. Recommended!](https://inurl.top/archives/mojie/ "MojieVPN: Reliable, fast, and affordable. Recommended!")**
- **[China International Airport VPN: Stable with high bandwidth. Recommended!](https://inurl.top/archives/zhongguuojichangvpn/ "China International Airport VPN: Stable with high bandwidth. Recommended!")**

- If you primarily use Spotify or Google Search, **MojieVPN** will suit your needs perfectly.
