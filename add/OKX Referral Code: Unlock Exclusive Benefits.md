## What Is Cryptocurrency?

Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies secured by cryptography and powered by blockchain technology, which serves as a decentralized digital ledger. Transactions are recorded and validated on the blockchain, eliminating the need for centralized institutions like banks.

Popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Polkadot (DOT) showcase the versatility of blockchain technology. Institutional investments from companies such as Samsung, BlackRock, and Morgan Stanley demonstrate growing confidence in the crypto market.

With OKX, you can explore the vast opportunities of decentralized finance, including:

## The Evolution of Bitcoin and Blockchain

Bitcoin and blockchain technology have garnered increasing global recognition. Here are five key perspectives on their potential:
1. Bitcoin as a **virtual asset** similar to traditional investments.
2. Bitcoin as a **peer-to-peer payment system** with the potential to rival Visa.
3. The Bitcoin blockchain as **infrastructure for other blockchain applications**.
4. Bitcoin as a **virtual internet currency** with unique features for online transactions.
5. Bitcoin as **digital gold**, offering advantages in payment efficiency and cost preservation.

Many jurisdictions have begun embracing cryptocurrencies with regulatory frameworks, including:
- **Japan:** Recognized Bitcoin as legal currency.
