# How to Use the OKX Web3 Wallet for Runes Minting and Trading

## Introduction

The Bitcoin Runes protocol is gaining massive attention, even overshadowing the hype around Bitcoin halving. With the increased activity driven by Runes minting, Bitcoin block transaction fees have surged to 20 BTC. Miners, instead of worrying about reduced rewards post-halving, are celebrating record-high earnings, reinvigorating the mining community.

Runes is a layer-1 asset issuance protocol introduced by Casey, the creator of the Ordinals protocol, built on Bitcoin. It is expected to launch alongside Bitcoin's halving.

While you can etch Runes using your own full node, the complexity and high entry barriers make it impractical for most users. Instead, the **OKX Web3 Wallet** and **Runes Marketplace** provide a simple, user-friendly solution with zero platform fees. Let’s walk through the steps to get started.

### Step 2: Start Minting or Purchase Pre-Minted Runes

#### Minting Runes

#### Buying Pre-Minted Runes
Alternatively, you can purchase pre-minted Runes:

2. Review details like price, holders, transactions, and progress.
3. Select a Rune and click **Mint** to acquire it.

### Step 3: Trading Runes in the Marketplace
If minting isn’t your preference, start trading Runes:
1. Browse the **Trending** section for popular Runes.
2. Purchase Runes listed by other users, and then list them for resale to earn a profit.
