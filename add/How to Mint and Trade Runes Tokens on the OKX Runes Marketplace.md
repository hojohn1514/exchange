## How to Sell Runes

To sell or list Runes tokens:
1. Open your Web3 wallet and navigate to **Market > Runes**.

3. Choose one or more UTXOs (unspent transaction outputs) containing your tokens.
4. Set your desired price and click **Confirm**.

*Note: Runes tokens are based on the UTXO model. For example, if you own 10,000 tokens distributed across two UTXOs (e.g., UTXO 1 holds 3,000 tokens, and UTXO 2 holds 2,000 tokens), selecting UTXO 1 will list only the 3,000 tokens it contains.*
